        <br>

Digital projects can be managed using different project management methodologies.
Agile with Scrum is a very common approach in software development but other methods like Waterfall, PRINCE2 and Extreme Programming are similarly used when shipping digital projects.
It’s a matter of preference and the nature of your project.

<p>
        <br>
A good Project Manager will be able to select and execute the right method for your team and project. Most digital projects go through the same 5-steps.

Scoping.
Planning.
Development.
Testing & Deployment.
Maintenance.

<p>
        <br>

Scoping includes:
	Ideation and brainstorming sessions with the client, requirements are defined for the implementation of the idea, and an estimation of time and costs is set up.
	A meeting across the team, discussing the scope, milestones, and who's part of which tasks.
	The Statement of Work is presented to the key stakeholders, incl. costs and initial requirements. If agreed, the SOW is signed by both sides, i.e., the agency and the client.

    <p>
            <br>
Planning includes:
	A detailed plan for the implementation of the idea is laid out and put into an agreed roadmap.
	Creative teams are engaged, and the consumer's user experience is initiated and designed.
	Requirements and design guidelines are handed over to Development in the next phase.

    <p>
            <br>

Development includes:
	Back-end development of the architecture supporting the development and final product can begin.
	Alpha and Beta versions build on top of the back-end, and the final design specifications are implemented to the front-end.
	Key stakeholders are brought in again: Revisions and polishing is done in collaboration with the client. Feedback is taken in, and adjustments are made.
	Final touches are made to get ready for Testing & Deployment.

    <p>
            <br>

Testing & Deployment includes:
	Testing of the code and use-cases. Were all requirements and specifications implemented successfully?
	Quality Assessment (QA) conducts an analysis of the final product before it is pushed live.
	Product is deployed and goes live.
	The project transforms into the Maintenance phase.
    <p>
            <br>
Maintenance includes:
	Improvement of functionality and bug fixing
	Addressing stability issues and keeping the system running
	Support of the product.

                    <p>         
                            When working on digital projects there are risks such as software crashing and progress or data being lost. 
                            Sometimes this is human error sometimes there are ‘bug’s’  that cause thing’s to fail. Ultimately this would hinder an online project if stored on the internet ‘cloud based’ or ‘local based’ on the specific machine you're working from.
                            Additionally depending on the project and the form of collaboration if any and the final delivery, there may be cyber security risks if the platform/network is not encrypted and protected.
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            As digital initiatives jump to the top of many C-suite executives’ priority lists, many are failing for common reasons:
                            Misalignment with business processes: Marketing may build a beautiful new website with a great user experience, but if they overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is very likely to fail. 
                            This often happens when teams put technology ahead of strategy, falling for the hype of new innovative tools before considering the business process implications of the new technology. 
                            Aligning digital and business goals and integrating new products seamlessly with business operations is critical to project success.
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            Lack of cross-functional expertise: Similar to number 1, there’s a common misconception that digital projects only need “digital people.” 
                            But every digital project should have someone with business process management skills to help scope and plan the alignment between the customer journey and back-end operational processes.
                            Limited digital strategy. 
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            Many digital projects are focused solely on the objective of one department or initiative, rather than contributing to the overall company’s digital strategy and business goals. Define specifically what success looks like for the project and how it contributes to the company’s business strategy before moving forward.
                            Fixed plans that don’t account for change: The notion of a “5-year-plan” is dead. Using Agile, iterative processes that allow for frequent tweaks and improvement is the only way to ensure that success is lasting. 
                            Your digital project plans should be flexible enough to reflect business changes within the company and the market at any given moment.
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            Overambition: Expecting perfection instead of embracing the “done is better than perfect” mantra tends to result in projects that drag on way past their scope. Explore the idea of releasing “Minimum Viable Products,” or early versions of software that gauge how the market will respond and determine if the concept is worth pursuing. 
                            Saying “Let’s launch a perfect site within the next 3 months” without a real business plan is a sure path to failure.
                            Most of these factors share one common root cause: the inadequate understanding of business processes.

                    <p>         
                            There are many different factors to take into account when selecting technology and the correct software suitable for results...
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            1. Keep it simple. Go agile!
                            Often, the technology you choose will never wind up mattering, because the product itself fails. Many startups go with a scaling technology and spend time and energy on a robust build, only to find out that there’s no market for their product.
                            Whenever you want to build a product from scratch, the best option is to go with the easiest solution. A landing page with Wordpress or Unbounce could well be enough. As soon as you know that your concept will work, you can move forward with building the product. Stay agile during this phase. Think: first things first. Get a basic page running, then your first feature, then your second. The advantages of doing things this way are that you can evaluate progress in real-time and change direction as needed. You minimize your risk because your system is already running. You may not yet have all the features you had imagined, but it’s running!
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            2. Think about your personal requirements
                            Keep your problem space in mind. The technology you choose should depend on the problem you want to solve. Users before technology
                            Products should be built for their users. What product do you want to build? How can you create the best user experience? Think about who will be using your system. Will they work on desktops or tablets?
                            Migrations & legacy systems
                            Do you have databases and/or data which need to be migrated? Do you have legacy systems which need to be transferred to the new system? These and similar considerations need to be examined and evaluated.
                            Security
                            Security should never be neglected. Depending on the kind of data you work with, security could even be the most important factor. Determine why you need to secure something before deciding how to secure it. But remember, technology isn’t everything — keep in mind that security depends primarily on the skill set of your developers, the work environment and the policies you implement.
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            3. Go for open-source technologies
                            When building new software, you should seek out open-source solutions. They prevent you from having to build everything from scratch; it will save you a lot of time and is probably more secure (many heads are better than few). You’ll also be able to focus on the business side of things and making your product stand out. Remember to give back to the open-source community!
                            Once you’ve singled out a prospective technology, you should run through a checklist. What kind of license does it have? Does the language or framework have the features you or your developers need? How many core developers are there? You can check out the contributors or stars in the Github repository and how they have evolved over time. Is the source code easy to understand if you need to go deeper and check the algorithm under the hood? Is the documentation comprehensive, is the tech thoroughly tested, and are there starter boilerplates to get you going quickly?
                            Another important question: how does the team behind the technology deal with security problems? Is there an email address for reporting security vulnerabilities?
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            4. Check the ecosystem
                            Every technology has an ecosystem composed of people and tools.
                            How big is the ecosystem behind the language or framework? How many Stackoverflow questions, conferences, and online tutorials (e.g. Udemy) are there? What does Google Trends say? Is interest in the software still growing? How many packages (npm, PyPi, etc.) are there, and do they have licenses you can work with?
                            Do you know about the awesome awesome lists? They help you dig into the ecosystem of a language or framework. You can check tutorials, articles, and important packages relating to a given technology. There are lists for Django, node.js, React, Angular, and many more.
                            Also important: is the community welcoming new members, and how active is the community? How is the support for users and developers? Is there a mailing list, a chat channel, a Slack room, or a ticketing system? Are people blogging about the technology?
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            5. Long-term trends & support
                            Market lifecycles
                            Every technology has a lifecycle. You want to choose mature technologies because they are reliable. You should check the latest Technology Radar to get an idea of how future-proof technologies are; this can help you decide whether to adopt them or put them on hold. The Technology Radar is free and it separates technologies into the categories of Techniques, Platforms, Tools and Languages & Frameworks. However, you should use the resource with caution, as the information is provides is not set in stone.
                            Another idea is to check industry-favorite technology stacks with stackshare.io or techstacks.io. Check out what Airbnb is using or what people like about AngularJS and who is using it. If you’re unsure about a technology, you can search for alternatives. Here is a list of alternatives to Angular JS on alternativeto.net.
                            Long-term vendor support
                            Does the technology vendor look like they’ll be around for a while? Are big companies sponsoring the development of the tech in question? Google is behind Angular, and Facebook is behind React. This means that there should be some progress, until the company eventually decides to drop their support (yes, this can happen). But the bigger the community, the bigger the chance that things will stick around for quite some time.
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            6. Human resources & recruiting
                            What developers do you have on your side? If you have to decide on a front-end technology and you have three strong Angular developers, you should probably work with those. Moving fast can be important, and it’s quite an advantage to have people who are in their comfort zone instead of learning a new technology. Also, existing knowledge of the ecosystem is an additional benefit.
                            Regarding recruiting, be sure to check the following: can you find enough quality developers for the desired technology? How much do you need to pay them? Are big companies working with the same technologies and snatching up all the good developers? Are the developers you find mostly established professionals, or is it hard to differentiate between them and the script kiddies? A good Java developer may be easier to find than a good Ruby on Rails or PHP developer. For your research, you can check XING, LinkedIn or job search portals. You can also check for job trends (e.g. comparing Angular with React).
                            Is the technology easy to learn? An easy language can help you find and train junior developers, and the whole ecosystem could attract more people.
                            Last but not least: a great resource in HR is the Stackoverflow Developer survey. It provides a great overview of developer types, utilized technologies and salary reports. Have a look!
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            7. Will you be flexible enough?
                            Service granularity
                            Things are changing much more quickly than they were 20 years ago. For a long time, people worked primarily on desktop computers and with Windows. This will probably not be the case in another 10 years. Your chosen technology will probably stay with you for 5 to 10 years: this is a long time, and you can’t be sure how things will evolve. That’s why you need to be prepared to change technologies when the need arises.
                            Think granular, think in little packages, and think in separation of concerns. You should separate services, back-ends and front-ends into smaller applications and micro-services.
                            Can you bail? Will it scale?
                            Do you always have access to the data? Is it always possible to export your data if you need to change technologies? Does the technology have an API to allow flexibility on the other end? Maybe you want to open your application for your clients or customers, or you want to build mobile apps, desktop apps or other systems on top of the chosen technology.
                            <p>
                                    <br>
                            8. How does it feel?
                            Have your developers look into the technology, or do so yourself. What are your first impressions? Have a little pilot setup, try out existing boilerplates, or (if possible) have a little test project. If you go with granular services, you can build a new little service with a given technology and see how it works.
                            There are also real-world applications which can give you a better understanding of the differences. TodoMVC is a great project — a simple Todo app is realized with different Javascript frameworks, and you can check out the source code architecture.

                            If you are a small startup, getting to market is more important than having the perfect tech. Focus on your business and marketing rather than having all the technology pre-optimization necessary to handle the amount of users Facebook has. You probably won’t have all the required knowledge at an early stage, but you can fine-tune and optimize things or change tech stacks as you grow (and have the requisite budget).
                            As an enterprise, things can be different. The decision will mostly be political anyway — people in your company need to be okay with your decision. The management (and hopefully the in-house / prospective developers) are probably the most important stakeholders to have on board.
                            It’s important to keep in mind that quality is a matter of doing things properly. Technology isn’t the only thing that matters: you need the right design, the right requirements, the right testing procedures, and so on. The most important thing is making sure that you don’t limit yourself in terms of scale or migrating to a different technology in the future.

Trello is basically an online corkboard, You can organize cards and move them along the board to show any progress you have made or if the task is complete. It’s a simple idea: for good project management and gives you full visibility for relevant tasks and flexibility to arrange them.

Trello provides the following:
Accountability
Sanity
Visualization
Organization

Using a Trello board, you can create order in your work by organizing it into tasks and a list of cards. This makes brilliant for adaptability to different circumstances.
 
Trello solves the problem of:
Long email threads
Wasted meetings
Accountability
Clarifying projects
Forgetfulness
Transparency

Github 
Github is basically cloud hosting website for your code and to share your code with members of your team. You will have to:
Create and use a repository
Start and manage a new branch
Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
Open and merge a pull request

Checks (aka Commit Statuses)
You may have GitHub configured to run unit tests or other tasks on all new changesets. If so, the GitHub Power-Up shows whether a given Pull Request has passed (or failed) the configured checks.

                                                    With legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects, here are the eight basics GDPR...

                                                    Under the GDPR, individuals have:
                                                    The right to access –this means that individuals have the right to request access to their personal data and to ask how their data is used by the company after it has been gathered. The company must provide a copy of the personal data, free of charge and in electronic format if requested.
                                                    The right to be forgotten – if consumers are no longer customers, or if they withdraw their consent from a company to use their personal data, then they have the right to have their data deleted.
                                                    The right to data portability – Individuals have a right to transfer their data from one service provider to another. And it must happen in a commonly used and machine readable format.
                                                    The right to be informed – this covers any gathering of data by companies, and individuals must be informed before data is gathered. Consumers have to opt in for their data to be gathered, and consent must be freely given rather than implied.
                                                    The right to have information corrected – this ensures that individuals can have their data updated if it is out of date or incomplete or incorrect.
                                                    The right to restrict processing – Individuals can request that their data is not used for processing. Their record can remain in place, but not be used.
                                                    The right to object – this includes the right of individuals to stop the processing of their data for direct marketing. There are no exemptions to this rule, and any processing must stop as soon as the request is received. In addition, this right must be made clear to individuals at the very start of any communication.
                                                    The right to be notified – If there has been a data breach which compromises an individual’s personal data, the individual has a right to be informed within 72 hours of first having become aware of the breach.
                                                    The GDPR is the EU’s way of giving individuals, prospects, customers, contractors and employees more power over their data and less power to the organizations that collect and use such data for monetary gain.

                                     <br>          
                                                    This regulation has been implemented in all local privacy laws across the entire EU and EEA region. It will apply to all companies selling to and storing personal information about citizens in Europe, including companies on other continents.
                                                    What GDPR means is that citizens of the EU and EEA now have greater control over their personal data and assurances that their information is being securely protected across Europe.
                                                    According to the GDPR directive, personal data is any information related to a person such as a name, a photo, an email address, bank details, updates on social networking websites, location details, medical information, or a computer IP address.
                                                    There is no distinction between personal data about individuals in their private, public or work roles – the person is the person. Also in a B2B setting, everything is about individuals interacting and sharing information with and about each other. Customers in B2B market are obviously companies, but the relationships that handle the business topics are people – or individuals.
