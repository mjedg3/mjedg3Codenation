                <br>
        Through using the IT tools such as Visual Studio Code to build my website with the use of HTML 5, to build the foundations of the site in terms of data and then styling through CSS and functionality would be added through Javascript.
        The use of “google” helped when styling my design was inspired through instagram, referencing etc…
        I kept monitor of tasks through Trello and shared my content and things through Slack this helped with progress of activities, it also would be a transferable skill to take into a working profession when completing projects.
        To critically evaluate and review my website, overall I like the styling and simplicity of the home page the front end but in terms of functionality I would like to explore more with Javascript and basically go into more detail to make the user experience more intuitive.
        I found it tricky at times with jumping from one language to another but I think through creating more, I will only become more familiar with what was possible in each HTML, CSS, JS…

                <h5 class="aboutme"><br>
        
        I would change my approach by simplifying thing’s before styling so much and even considering the way in which it looks, although front end is important for the user and publishing things… I would concentrate more on the way thing’s work and take a step back from my usual creative design ways… I was happy using all of the above tools though and they where useful.

            <h5 class="aboutme"><br>
        
        The IT tools were appropriate and helped in a number of different ways, again Trello/Slack useful for organisation and workflow. I was only introduced to Visual Studio Code, but would also like to attempt to build in react which I believe is a more advanced platform to build with… But all that was used, still produced results and the use of the Github was good for hosting, testing and other people accessing the repo if needed to update etc… 
        
        <h3 class="questions">2 . 3</h3>

                    </p>
                    <h5 class="aboutme"><br>
        
        
        I’m happy overall with my final project and website, I am quite proud with the way it looks and the styling I think my strengths are with my creativity and imagination, but again I would like to learn more Javascript and look at advancements of functionally and making thing’s more responsive and reactive to user navigation and accessibility. If I was to design again I would concentrate more on the build and the basics, then the functionality rather than how it looks so this would be the negative part of my workflow I had a big focus on how it looks rather then lets make this work…
        
        <h3 class="questions">2 . 4</h3>
                <p>  
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="aboutme"><br>
        
        Further improving my website, I would look more into Javascript and possible other languages to make more effective thing’s happen to make it more advanced, making user experience more fun and quirky. 
        
        <h3 class="questions">2 . 5</h3>
        <p>  
            </p>
            <h5 class="aboutme"><br>
      
        After reviewing, the outcomes and needs of the site, I had to have a navigation bar which would take me from each section of the website and answer the questions styling was selected and presented.

        Develop and test solutions to improve ongoing use of IT tools and systems 
        
        Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  
        Visual Studio
        VS code is fantastic tool to write HTML5 and CSS, I have found it to be easy to pick up and the live updates are great to check your work on the fly. Debugging functions are brilliant for easily identifying any problems with your code.Visual studio is also customisable and you can download third-party extensions which are massively helpful. 
        
        Trello 
        Trello has been great, using the cards to keep an I on progress of the website and just remember to move cards over which can be a pain. 
         
        Trello: Benefits include:
        Minimizing confusion around project assignments with simple tools to organize tasks and track progress.
        Customizable lists that allow users to follow metrics they are most interested in and use automated notifications to keep informed of all changes.
        Simple collaboration that allows entire teams to participate in important discussions, send notes, share files and comment on individual tasks.

        3.2
        
        Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency 
        The best way to improve productivity and efficiency is to track the time and maybe restrict the time spent on tasks. Try not to multitask, make a habit of committing to a single task and finish it before moving onto your next task. Also do not strive for perfection as the reality is nothing is ever perfect. Try not to waste time chasing this illusion. Put your phone and other distractions are out of eyesight or ear shot because when you are in the zone you don't want to be interrupted, so turn off notifications.Researcher say you should work in 90 minute intervals and they also after 4.5 hours you will be less effective.

        3.3
        
        Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – 
        I would personally use both Slack and Trello for referencing from our team work, I found it extremely effective for collaborating but also for my own personal workflow. The practice of it helped and will help for the future too.
