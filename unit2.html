            Describing the content and layout for each page 
            I have designed a website styled upon Instagram; this was to allow the user a similar experience and recognisable interface.
            Arguably instagram is the most powerful platform for reach, therefore I thought it would be effective to replicate it as close to possible. I hope you enjoy it…</p>

            There are copyright  and other constraints affecting websites,  which could possibly lead to law pursuits. 
            This could be something as simple as using a photograph that you don’t own, so I would try to my own imagery and design where possible.
            Copyright protects "works"
            Copyright law protects a diversity of "copyright works". It protects the oil painting, operatic symphony and poetic epic with the same principles and rules as the doodle, the advertising ditty, and the slap-dash legal article.
            Although "websites" are not a kind of copyright work, their constituent elements are likely to be protected by copyright. Website text and code may be protected as literary works; photographs and other website artworks may be protected as artistic works; website music tracks may be protected both as musical works and through sound recording copyright. A single video clip can accommodate a profusion of different rights.
            Copyright v other IP rights
            Copyright must be properly distinguished from other kinds of intellectual property (IP) right: patents, trade marks, rights in designs, database rights, and so on. Nothing, but nothing, pains the IP expert more than many journalists' apparent belief that the different kinds of IP right are interchangeable.
            Acts of infringement
            Copyright infringement isn't just about copying. There are lots of different ways to infringe someone's copyright, and many of them don't directly involve 
            copying. For instance, selling over your website CDs that someone else ripped may be copyright infringement.
             Again, making an adaptation of a copyright work, for instance recreating a motion picture as a cartoon strip,
             can infringe copyright, even if there is no literal copying.

            While downloading files and viewing websites, you’ll meet up with many file formats. Most are common, and encountered frequently, others are more obscure and require specialist programs to open or use. Here, we have a list of the file types, along with the applications you’ll need to get them going on your computer.

            .AVI — Audio/Video Interleaved

            .CSS — Cascading StyleSheet
            CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look. To read more about them.
            .DOC — Microsoft Word DOCument
            Microsoft Word is the most popular word processing software in the world. You probably won’t come across loads of doc files, but if you do it can be annoying if you haven’t got a program that can open them.
            .EXE — EXEcutable file
            If you download a program that you need to install, it will likely come as an exe file.

            .MIDI/ .MID — Musical Instrument Digital Interface
            Midis are sequenced music files made on keyboards. They’re usually really small and often sound great, although it largely depends on your soundcard. Midi collections are one of the few places in the world where you can find classic game and movie music, and for that I salute them.
            .MP3 — MPEG Layer 3 sound file
            Single Handedly caused a revolution. MP3 is a sound file format which is highly compressed, which allows download-happy file sizes and excellent quality. Has caused much grief for the music industry as songs are now small enough to be traded online.
            .MPEG/ .MPG — Motion Picture Experts Group file
            One of the standards for streaming movies.

            .PNG — Portable Network Graphics
            PNGs are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport advanced features like alpha-channel transparency and 24-bit colour support. .RAM — Real Audio Movie
            Real Networks created formats for streaming audio and video, and gave away free players for the formats, before allowing themselves to become so smothered in advertising that everyone with sense decided to stop using their programs.
            .RAR — RAR archive
            This is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format. It sports advanced functions like special multimedia compression and has many benefits over zip files.
            .TIFF — Tagged Image File Format
            For really high quality images, TIFFs are used, but cannot be viewed through a browser.

            The most basic of files, it’s just some text.
            .WAV — WAVe sound file
            A basic, either in- or not very- compressed sound file, usually used for short sound samples.
            .ZIP — ZIPped file
            Zipped files are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit. Many downloads will consist of zip collections, so be sure to have something to open them with.
            Streaming Media
            Over the past few years many new file formats were brought in for the reason of allowing streaming — that is, the file starts playing as soon as it begins to be downloaded, and keeps on playing as more of the file makes its way to your computer. The hugely successful mp3 quickly became the most popular of these formats. The proprietary RealAudio and RealVideo formats from » Real are popular among multimedia sites, but are terrible formats that require a truly horrible piece of software to play. Mpeg, AVI and MP4 video are also very popular, and can be played in many programs like Quicktime Player, VLC and Windows Media Player. These types of files are most important when embedding multimedia.
